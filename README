Description of pktools
----------------------
The version of this pktools distribution is 2.5.1
pktools is a collection of programs written in C++ to perform operations, mostly on raster images. It heavily relies on the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL, http://www.gdal.org) and OGR. The programs are similar to the gdal tools (gdalinfo, gdal_translate, gdal_merge,...) and some of the functionalities provided in pktools already exist in the gdal tools. The reason for implementing pktools is a combination of personal preference and additional functionality.
