Description of pktools
----------------------
The version of this pktools distribution is 20120625
pktools is a collection of programs written in C++ to perform operations on raster images.
It heavily relies on the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL, www.gdal.org) and OGR. Some of the programs are similar to the gdal tools (gdalinfo, gdal_translate, gdal_merge,...) and many of the functionalities provided in pktools already exist. The reason for implementing pktools is a combination of personal preference and in some case additional functionality.
