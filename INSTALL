How to install pktools
----------------------

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and build out of source using cmake:
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..

     to enable fann and liblas libraries, use
     cmake -DBUILD_WITH_FANN=ON and -DBUILD_WITH_LIBLAS=ON respectively

     In that case, please make sure to first install libfann-dev and liblas-dev.
     
  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You probably will need sudo rights (root access) to write into
     /usr/local/bin directory (default installation directory).
