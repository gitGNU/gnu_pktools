How to install pktools
----------------------

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.
     
     configure options (use ./configure --help for help info)
     
        --with-gdal=<path to gdal-config file>
     	--enable-fann
	--enable-las
	--enable-nlopt

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You probably will need sudo rights (root access) to write into
     /usr/local/bin directory (default installation directory).
