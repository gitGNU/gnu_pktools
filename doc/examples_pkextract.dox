\code
pkextract -i input.tif -s points.shp -o extracted.shp
\endcode
extract the points read in points.shp from input.tif. Create a new point vector file  extracted.shp, where each point will contain an attribute for the individual input bands in input.tif.

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -s points.shp -m mask.tif -msknodata 255 -o extracted.shp 
\endcode
extract all bands from input.tif to extracted.shp at pixel locations defined in points.shp that have not a value 255 in mask.tif

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -s polygons.shp -o training.shp -r point
\endcode
extract all pixels from input.tif covered by the polygons in locations.shp. Each polygon can thus result in multiple point features with attributes for each input band. Write the extracted points to a point vector file training.shp.

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -b 0 -s polygons.shp -r centroid -o extracted.shp -polygon  
\endcode
extract the first band from input.tif at the centroids of the polygons in vector filepolygons.shp. Assign the extracted point value to a new attribute of the polygon and write to the vector file extracted.shp.

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -b 1 -s polygons.shp -r mean -o extracted.shp -polygon  
\endcode
extract the mean values for the second band in input.tif covered by each polygon in polygons.shp. The mean values are written to a copy of the polygons in output vector file extracted.shp

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -s sample.tif -o extracted.shp -t 10 -c 1 -c 2 -c 3
\endcode
Typical use where pixels are extracted based on a land cover map (sample.tif). Extract all bands for a random sample of 10 percent of the pixels in the land cover map sample.tif where the land cover classes are either 1,2 or 3 (class values). Write output to the point vector file extracted.shp.

\code
pkextract -i input.tif -s sample.tif -o extracted.shp -t -5000 -c 1
\endcode
extract all bands for the first 5000 pixels encountered in sample.tif where pixels have a value equal to 1. Write output to point vector file extracted.shp.
