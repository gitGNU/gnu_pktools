\section pkann_description Description

The utility pkann implements an artificial neural network (ANN) to solve a supervised classification problem. The implementation is based on the open source C++ library <a href="http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/">fann</a>). Both raster and vector files are supported as input. The output will contain the classification result, either in raster or vector format, corresponding to the format of the input. A training sample must be provided as an OGR vector dataset that contains the class labels and the features for each training point. The point locations are not considered in the training step. You can use the same training sample for classifying different images, provided the number of bands of the images are identical. Use the utility \ref pkextract "pkextract" to create a suitable training sample, based on a sample of points or polygons. For raster output maps you can attach a color table using the option -ct.
